## Idea
90% deterministic models, 10% LLM. Deterministic will buy/sell - use a formula called Constant Product Market Maker (xy = k, x = YES, y = NO). LLMs use different models (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) with different personalities. Smart contracts - master wallet that acts as a fund for the agents and only use a specified amount of money - deterministic models have less cash than LLMs because they are generating liquidity and noise.
